## Google maps travel plans

Here are my suggestions for traveling in several different countries.
You can find the source files in the files-to-import folder, and use them to visualize on google maps. The idea is to have a structure, starting point, for your own plannings.



## How to Import KMZ Files into Google My Maps

Google My Maps is a powerful tool that allows you to create custom maps and add various layers of information. One of the supported file formats for importing data into Google My Maps is KMZ, which stands for Keyhole Markup Language (KML) compressed with ZIP.

### Step 1: Prepare Your KMZ File

Before you can import a KMZ file into Google My Maps, make sure you have the KMZ file ready on your computer. If you don't have a KMZ file yet, you can create one using tools like Google Earth or other mapping software.

### Step 2: Access Google My Maps

Open your web browser and go to [Google My Maps](https://www.google.com/mymaps). Sign in with your Google account if you haven't already.

### Step 3: Create a New Map (Optional)

If you want to import the KMZ data into a new map, click on the "+ Create a new map" button. If you already have a map that you want to update with the KMZ data, select the existing map from your list of "Your Places."

### Step 4: Import the KMZ File

- In the Google My Maps interface, click on the "Import" button in the left-hand panel.
- Select the "Upload" tab.
- Drag and drop your KMZ file into the designated area or click on "Select a file from your device" to browse and upload the KMZ file from your computer.

### Step 5: Review and Edit

Google My Maps will process your KMZ file and display the imported data as a new layer on your map. Take a moment to review the imported data and make any necessary adjustments.

- You can change the name of the layer by clicking on the "Untitled layer" text and entering a new name.
- Customize the appearance of the layer by clicking on the paint roller icon, where you can change the color and style of the pins or lines.

### Step 6: Save Your Map

Once you're satisfied with the imported data and any edits you've made, don't forget to save your map. Click on the "Save" button in the upper-left corner of the Google My Maps interface.

### Step 7: Share Your Map (Optional)

If you want to share your map with others, you can click on the "Share" button and adjust the sharing settings accordingly. You can share the map privately with specific people or make it public for anyone to view.

That's it! You've successfully imported your KMZ file into Google My Maps, and now you can explore, edit, and share your custom map with your data displayed in a visually engaging way. Enjoy using Google My Maps to visualize and share your geographic information!
